Diploma thesis for Aristotle University of Thessaloniki for Intergrated Master's Degree in Civil Engineering.
The thesis’ goal is the optimal remediation of an aquifer, with the method of extracting the polluting substance from the aquifer with wells (“Pump and Treat” method). The thesis research started in collaboration with the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT), with the title “Integrated water management system with the combined use of opensource software and metaheuristic optimization algorithms”. The data used in the problem, were taken from the assignment of the course “Exploitation and Protection of Groundwater Resources” of the School of Civil Engineering, Aristotle University of Thessaloniki. In the theoretical problem, the aquifer is polluted by a leakage from a Wastewater Treatment Plant. For the simulation of the water flow and the transportation of the pollution in the aquifer, MODFLOW 6 and the Python library, FloPy, were used. The optimal solution of the problem are the minimum inflows and the location of the two pumping wells. The optimization method used, is the metaheuristic algorithm, Harmony Search Algorithm (HSA). The best solution is confirmed with a sensitivity test, for the conductivity of the aquifer.

The first file you should run is the flopy modflow model -> which solves the aquifer parameters.
Then you should run the hsaalgorithm to find the best solution to the aquifer polution problem.
